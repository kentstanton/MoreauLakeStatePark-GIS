Moreau Lake State Park GIS Base Layers

Base map layers for the Moreau Lake State Park GIS. The four layers are in the KML format for ease of use with
non-specialist mapping tools such as Google Earth. These layers are offered for use by anyone at their own risk. These 
layers may contain gross errors and no guarantee of accuracy should be assumed. Respect private propery. 
On-the-ground boundary markers should be assumed to trump map representations. 

mlsp_trails_april_2017.kml: A polyline (multi-segment lines) layer representing hiking trails in Moreau Lake State Park. The 
trails layer is up-to-date as of April 2017 including new trails in the Lake Bonita annex. Trails are labeled as seen
on park maps and signs. Unmarked trails are shown with tentative names. (example: "Lake Bonita Loop")

moreau_lake_state_park_boundary.kml: A polygon layer representing the boundary of Moreau Lake State Park as of April 2017. The 
boundary layer includes newly added sections including the Lake Bonita annex. The layer was created by combining 
publically available representations. The Lake Bonita section was hand digitized from maps published by the New York State 
Office of Parks and Recreation. This map layer provides a generalized representative of the park boundary 
but it may contain errors or inaccurate representations.

mlsp_trail_junction_april_2017.kml: Point layer representing the locations of trail junctions in the park. The junction names 
match those used on trail signs in the park. Junctions labeled 'S'<number> are formal marked junctions. Junctions labeled 'K'<number> 
are informal or unmarked junctions. Junctions labeled 'U'<number> are junctions on new trails that are likely to be marked in 
the near future.

moreau_lake_state_park_trail_access_parking.kml: Locations of places where hikers can park to gain access to the park. These 
parking areas include designated parking areas as well as informal but commonly used access points. Always park so as to not block traffic. Not all areas are plowed in the winter.
